SIRAH Force Field documentation
===============================

[SIRAH](http://www.sirahff.com/) is a coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations that offers plug-and-play topologies and parameters for aqueous solvent, phospholipids, DNA, metal ions, and proteins. It was designed, implemented, and developed by the [Biomolecular Simulations Group](https://pasteur.uy/laboratorios/simulaciones-biomoleculares/) at the [Institut Pasteur de Montevideo](https://pasteur.uy/), Uruguay, which is also responsible for its regular maintenance.

The current version, **SIRAH 2.0**, includes:

- A series of modifications to both bonded and non-bonded parameters of amino acids while preserving their original topologies;
- A description of different protonation states and post-translational modifications for protein residues;
- An improvement in compatibility for mapping different force field atom types and experimental structures;
- The ability to leverage GPU acceleration in AMBER and GROMACS codes;
- A collection of scripts, known as **SIRAH Tools**, that facilitate the process of mapping all-atom files to CG representations, backmapping, visualizing, and analyzing SIRAH trajectories directly on the popular VMD program for molecular visualization.
